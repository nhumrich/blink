### 2026-02-07 — Sublist API is a silent corruption footgun
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing `merge_programs()` for multi-file imports
- **Description:** The sublist system (`new_sublist` / `sublist_push` / `finalize_sublist`) uses a shared `sl_items` array. If you create multiple sublists upfront and then interleave pushes to them, all sublists get the same `sl_start` and `finalize_sublist` computes wrong lengths. There's no error — you just get silently corrupted data that crashes later in `generate()` with an opaque "list index out of bounds: -1". Had to restructure to collect into Pact `List[Int]` temporaries first, then build each sublist sequentially (create → fill → finalize, one at a time). The API shape invites the wrong usage pattern. Consider: (a) making `new_sublist` set `sl_start` at finalize-time instead of creation-time, or (b) adding a runtime check that no other sublist is "open" when pushing.
- **Update 2026-02-08:** This bug resurfaced in the pattern parser — struct/tuple/enum/or-pattern parsing all called `parse_pattern()` inside open sublists, causing silent corruption (pact-203). Fixed all pattern sublist sites to use the collect-then-build pattern. The API footgun remains; all current call sites are now safe.

### 2026-02-07 — Module-level `let mut` redeclaration semantics are confusing
- **Category:** `ambiguity`
- **Severity:** `papercut` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Understanding how parser and codegen share the `np_*` node pool arrays in the amalgamated compiler
- **Description:** The amalgamated `pactc.pact` has duplicate `let mut np_kind: List[Int] = []` declarations (one from parser section, one from codegen section). The codegen deduplicates these to a single C variable, and only the first initialization runs. This works but is confusing — nothing in the spec or the code makes it obvious that the second declaration is a no-op rather than creating a new binding. This is an artifact of the amalgamation process, but it exposed a spec gap: what *should* happen when a module-level `let` name is declared twice? Error? Shadow? Merge? The spec should clarify.
- **Resolution (2026-02-14):** Panel vote 5-0 unanimous on all 3 questions: duplicate module-level `let` = compile error (E1004), `pub let mut` forbidden (E1006), function-local shadowing allowed but module-level not. See §2.12.1, DECISIONS.md.

### 2026-02-07 — Import system defeats `pub` visibility by requiring everything be `pub`
- **Category:** `spec-gap`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Splitting pactc.pact into 6 multi-file modules using the import system
- **Description:** The import system only brings `pub`-marked items into the merged program. But when an imported `pub fn` references module-internal helpers (non-pub functions, constants), those helpers are missing from the merged C output — the codegen emits calls to undeclared symbols. The fix was making *everything* `pub` in every module, which defeats the purpose of `pub` entirely. Root cause: the import mechanism operates at the AST declaration level (filtering which top-level nodes to include), but function bodies contain unresolved references to their module's internal symbols. Either: (a) the import system needs to transitively include non-pub items that pub items depend on, (b) codegen needs to emit all items from a module when any item from it is imported, or (c) the compilation model should change so each module is compiled to C independently and linked, rather than merging ASTs.

### 2026-02-08 — ~~Closure const-qualifier warnings flood every call site~~ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** ~~`annoying`~~ **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing HOF support (pact-222) and immutable captures (pact-218)
- **Description:** Closures are emitted as `const pact_closure*` variables (since the binding is immutable `let`), but calling through `fn_ptr` requires casting and passing `self` as the first argument — which expects `pact_closure*` (non-const). Every single closure call site generates a `-Wdiscarded-qualifiers` warning. Similarly, `pact_list_len`/`pact_list_get` in runtime.h don't accept `const pact_list*`, so any list stored as `const` triggers the same warning. The bootstrap output has dozens of these. Fix options: (a) make runtime.h functions accept `const` pointers where they don't mutate, (b) emit closures as non-const `pact_closure*`, (c) generate explicit casts at call sites to suppress warnings.

### 2026-02-09 — ~~Calling an undefined function produces no error~~ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `spec-gap`
- **Severity:** ~~`annoying`~~ **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing closure capture helpers; `capture_cast_expr` called `int_to_string()` which doesn't exist
- **Description:** ~~The compiler has no notion of "defined functions" at compile time.~~ Fixed: `resolve_names()` in `src/typecheck.pact` (Phase 1 of typechecking) now catches undefined functions (E0303) and undefined variables (E0302) with structured diagnostics before codegen runs.

### 2026-02-09 — ~~Method call fallback silently generates invalid C identifiers~~ PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Category:** `spec-gap`
- **Severity:** ~~`annoying`~~ **downgraded to `papercut`**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing Into trait; `x.into()` generated `x_into()` as a C function call
- **Description:** ~~Silently generates garbage C.~~ Now emits `W0501: unknown method 'nonexistent_method' — may fail at compile time` warning. Still a warning rather than a hard error, and the fallback codegen still runs, but at least the developer is informed. Could be upgraded to an error in future.

### 2026-02-09 — Generic list element types not propagated through function returns
- **Category:** `types`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing mutable captures (pact-219) and effect system handles
- **Description:** When a function returns `List[Str]`, the codegen registers the return as `CT_LIST` but drops the element type parameter. So `let caps = analyze_captures(...)` followed by `caps.get(i)` generates `(int64_t)(intptr_t)pact_list_get(caps, i)` — treating strings as integers. The fix required adding `fn_ret_list_names`/`fn_ret_list_elem` parallel registries and propagating element types through call expressions and let bindings. This is a recurring pattern: the CT_* type system has no way to express parameterized types (`List[Str]`, `Option[Int]`, `Result[Int, Str]`). Each one needed its own ad-hoc parallel registry. A proper type representation (even just a struct with a CT code + inner types) would eliminate the entire class of bugs.
- **Update (2026-02-25):** Systemic fix applied: ScopeVar enriched with `inner1`, `inner2`, `sname`, `sname2`, `extra` fields. All 10 parallel registries (var_structs, var_closures, var_options, var_results, var_iterators, var_aliases, var_handles, var_channels, var_list_elems, var_maps) migrated into ScopeVar. push_scope/pop_scope reduced from 11 frame_starts to 1. Adding new generic types now requires zero scope boilerplate — just use the ScopeVar fields. ~200 lines net deleted.

### 2026-02-09 — Result/Option return types silently compiled to `void`
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `blocking`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing `?` and `??` operators (pact-161)
- **Description:** `c_type_str()` has no case for `CT_RESULT` or `CT_OPTION`, defaulting to `"void"`. Functions declared as `fn foo() -> Result[Int, Str]` got C return type `void`, making `?` and `??` unusable. Additionally, the parser stored only `"Result"` as the return type string, discarding the type parameters `[Int, Str]`. Had to add `np_type_ann` storage on FnDef nodes and `resolve_ret_type_from_ann()` to reconstruct the full C type. Root cause is the same as the list element type issue: CT_* integers can't represent parameterized types, so every generic type needs special-case plumbing. Consider promoting to GAPS since this pattern will recur for every new generic type.

### 2026-02-10 — ~~Closure const-qualifier warnings compound with every new feature~~ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** ~~`annoying`~~ **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Testing HOF, closure captures, and TryFrom after codegen module split (pact-257)
- **Description:** The const-qualifier warning issue (see 2026-02-08 entry) continues to compound. Every new feature that touches closures — HOF `apply`/`apply_twice`, immutable captures, mutable captures — adds another wave of `-Wdiscarded-qualifiers` warnings. The test_hof.c output alone has 16 warnings. The bootstrap output has dozens. This makes it hard to spot *real* warnings in the noise. The underlying issue is unchanged (closures emitted as `const pact_closure*` but called through non-const function pointers), but the volume is now bad enough that it's worth prioritizing a fix. Recommend option (b) from the original entry: emit closures as non-const `pact_closure*`, since closures are heap-allocated and the `const` adds no real safety.

### 2026-02-10 — `?` operator in non-Result functions silently generates invalid C
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying` — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-02-24
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Writing TryFrom + `?` operator tests (pact-233)
- **Description:** The `?` operator emits early-return code: `if (__res.tag == 1) return (Result){.tag=1, .err=__res.err}`. If the enclosing function doesn't return `Result` (e.g. `fn main() -> Void`), this generates a C statement that returns a struct from a void function — which only surfaces as a gcc error, not a Pact-level diagnostic. During test development, the test file had to be restructured multiple times to wrap all `?` usage inside `Result`-returning helper functions. The compiler should check that `?` is only used inside functions whose return type is `Result[T, E]` (or `Option[T]` for `??`) and emit a clear error otherwise. This is another instance of the "defer validation to gcc" pattern — the compiler trusts the code is well-formed and emits garbage when it isn't.

### 2026-02-13 — Formatter: all functions must be `pub` for import to work
- **Category:** `tooling`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing the formatter module (pact-305) with `import formatter` from compiler.pact
- **Description:** Same as the 2026-02-07 `pub` visibility entry. All internal helper functions in formatter.pact had to be made `pub` because the import system only brings across `pub` items. Non-pub helpers called by the pub `format()` function were "undefined" in the merged output. This is the exact same issue as before — the import system needs transitive dependency resolution.

### 2026-02-13 — Formatter: comment attachment lossy for file-level and inline comments
- **Category:** `spec-gap`
- **Severity:** `papercut`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing comment preservation in the formatter (pact-305)
- **Description:** The parser attaches pending comments to the next AST node via `attach_comments()`, but this has gaps: (1) file-level header comments before the first declaration sometimes end up attached to the wrong node, (2) inline comments within function bodies are not reliably attached to their associated statement (they get attached to the next statement parsed, which may not be the intended one), (3) comments between declarations (e.g. between two functions) can be consumed by `skip_newlines()` and attached to the wrong function. The formatter can only emit comments where the parser stored them. Proper comment preservation would require either (a) storing comment positions relative to source lines and using heuristic reattachment, or (b) a CST (concrete syntax tree) that preserves all whitespace and comments positionally.

### 2026-02-13 — @tags annotation values emitted as pointer addresses instead of strings
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying` — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-02-24
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Validating test framework end-to-end (pact-314), creating `test_tags.pact` with `@tags(unit)`, `@tags(slow)`, `@tags(unit, integration)`
- **Description:** The `@tags` annotation is parsed correctly (tag count per test is right), but the tag *values* in the generated C code are pointer addresses instead of string literals. Generated output: `static const char* pact_test_tagged_unit_test_tags[] = {"106281597399504"};` instead of the expected `{"unit"}`. The codegen at `codegen.pact:798` does `tag_arr.concat("\"{tags.get(tgi)}\"")` where `tags` is `List[Str]` from `test_tag_lists: List[List[Str]]`. The `tags.get(tgi)` call appears to return the internal pointer representation of the string rather than the string value when used inside string interpolation within `.concat()`. This means `--test-tags` filtering always returns 0 results since tag strings never match. Tests themselves compile and run fine; only the tag metadata is corrupted.

### 2026-02-14 — `match` is a keyword but no helpful error when used as variable name — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `ergonomics`
- **Severity:** `annoying` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing CLI add/remove commands (pact-365) — AI agent used `let mut match = 1` as variable
- **Description:** Using the keyword `match` as a variable name causes the compiler to crash with an opaque "list index out of bounds: 4457" error instead of a clear diagnostic. The parser doesn't emit a "expected identifier, got keyword 'match'" error. AI code generators (and humans) are especially likely to use `match` as a variable name since it's a common English word. The compiler should produce a targeted error like "error: 'match' is a keyword and cannot be used as an identifier".
- **Resolution (2026-02-25):** Parser emits E1103 KeywordAsIdentifier for `match`, `if`, `fn`, `handler`, and all other keywords (parser.pact:2166+).

### 2026-02-14 — `get_env` builtin missing, no obvious way to access env vars — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `spec-gap`
- **Severity:** `annoying` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing lockfile-based import resolution (pact-367) — needed HOME for git cache path
- **Description:** There's no `get_env` builtin for reading environment variables. The stdlib gitdeps module works around this by shelling out (`shell_exec("printf '%s' $HOME > /tmp/_pact_home")` + `read_file`). The codegen registers builtins like `get_arg`, `file_exists`, `path_join`, `shell_exec`, `read_file`, `write_file` — but `get_env` is absent despite `getenv` existing in the C runtime. Should be added as a builtin with `reg_fn("get_env", CT_STRING)` and a case in codegen_expr.
- **Resolution (2026-02-24):** `get_env` is fully implemented: `reg_fn("get_env", CT_STRING)` at codegen.pact:129, codegen inlines `getenv()` call returning `Option[Str]` at codegen_expr.pact:1081, typecheck recognizes it at typecheck.pact:780/941. Test `test_get_env.pact` passes.

### 2026-02-14 — `\{` in strings trips up formatter round-trip
- **Category:** `tooling`
- **Severity:** `papercut`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Formatting stdlib files containing `\{` escape sequences for literal braces
- **Description:** The formatter produces lexer warnings when processing files that contain `\{` escape sequences in strings. Doesn't cause test failures (formatter tests pass) but produces noisy output during CI. The formatter's lexer pass should handle `\{` the same as `\"` and `\\` — as a valid escape that produces a literal character.

### 2026-02-14 — `\}` escape not handled by lexer — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `syntax`
- **Severity:** `annoying` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Writing JSON object literals in strings like `"\{\"name\":\"Alice\"}"`
- **Description:** Lexer handles `\{` (line 830 of lexer.pact) to escape literal braces from string interpolation, but `\}` falls through to unknown-escape handler which outputs `\` and drops the `}`. This produces corrupt C strings. Workaround: `}` doesn't need escaping since the interpolation parser tracks brace depth and `}` in string mode is just a regular character. However, symmetry suggests `\}` should also work as an escape sequence producing a literal `}`.
- **Resolution (2026-02-24):** Handled at lexer.pact:839-840 — `\}` escape produces literal `}`.

### 2026-02-14 — `List[Float]` broken in codegen — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `blocking`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Resolved:** 2026-02-24 — heap boxing implemented (`pact_alloc(sizeof(double))` on push, `*(double*)` dereference on get). Tests `test_list_float.pact` and `test_float_boxing.pact` pass.
- **Context:** JSON parser needed `List[Float]` for storing parsed float values
- **Description:** All lists use `void*` internally. `list.push(float_val)` emits `pact_list_push(list, (void*)float_val)` which fails — can't cast `double` to `void*`. Ints work via `(void*)(intptr_t)` cast, strings are already pointers, but floats need boxing (allocate a `double*` and store). The codegen's push handler (codegen_expr.pact ~line 1558) has special cases for INT and struct types but not FLOAT. Workaround: store floats as `List[Str]` and parse on retrieval.

### 2026-02-15 — Parser did not implement dot-continuation from spec §2.7
- **Category:** `syntax`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Formatter wraps long method chains (e.g. `.concat()`) across lines per spec §2.7, but parser didn't support dot-continuation
- **Description:** Spec §2.7 says "A statement continues when the next line starts with a dot: `.method()` chaining." The parser's `parse_postfix()` loop only checked for `.` on the current token without looking past newlines. Formatted code with wrapped `.concat()` chains would crash on re-parse because each `.concat(...)` line was treated as a separate (invalid) statement. Fixed by adding side-effect-free lookahead in `parse_postfix()`: peek past Newline/Comment tokens without consuming them, only call `skip_newlines()` if a Dot actually follows.

### 2026-02-22 — `{}` parsed as map literal but methods don't resolve on it — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `ambiguity`
- **Severity:** `annoying` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Writing `test_float_boxing.pact` with `let mut prices: Map[Str, Float] = {}`
- **Description:** The parser accepts `{}` and presumably creates some AST node for it, but variables initialized via `{}` don't resolve `.set()` or `.get()` — they hit the UnresolvedMethod fallback (E0505). The spec (§3.2.2) says "Literal syntax (List only)" and shows `Map.new()` as the construction method. So `{}` shouldn't parse as a map literal at all. Two options: (a) make the parser reject `{}` as an expression with a clear error ("use `Map()` to construct an empty map"), or (b) spec + implement `{}` as sugar for `Map.new()` with proper type propagation. The codebase universally uses `Map()` for construction, so option (a) aligns with current practice.
- **Resolution (2026-02-24):** Option (a) implemented. Parser rejects `{}` in expression position with error E1107: "empty '{}' is not a valid expression — use Map() for empty maps". Recovery advances past both tokens and returns a synthetic node so parsing continues.

### 2026-02-20 — `handler` keyword as param name crashes parser
- **Category:** `syntax`
- **Severity:** `blocking` — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-02-24
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** HTTP server module used `handler` as a function parameter name (e.g. `fn server_route(srv, method, pattern, handler)`)
- **Description:** `handler` is a keyword (`TokenKind.Handler`). When used as a parameter name, `expect_value(TokenKind.Ident)` detects the error and emits `KeywordAsIdentifier` but continues parsing. The real problem: when `handler` later appears in expression context (e.g. `route_handlers.push(handler)`), `parse_primary()` sees the `Handler` token and dispatches to `parse_handler_expr()`, which expects `handler EffectName { fn... }` syntax. It consumes tokens looking for `}`, eating the rest of the file, then crashes on out-of-bounds token access. Fixed by checking lookahead in `parse_primary()` — only dispatch to `parse_handler_expr()` if the next token is an Ident (the effect name). Otherwise emit `KeywordAsIdentifier` error and treat as a plain identifier. Also added EOF guard to `parse_block()` while loop.

### 2026-02-24 — Formatter drops @derive annotations from type definitions
- **Category:** `tooling`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing `@derive(Serialize, Deserialize)` for JSON codegen (#44)
- **Description:** The formatter does not preserve `@derive(...)` annotations on type definitions. Formatted output loses the annotation entirely, so the formatted code no longer compiles (methods like `to_json()` become undefined). All test files using `@derive` had to be added to `fmt_skip` in the CI script. This is part of a broader issue where the formatter drops all annotations on type definitions.

### 2026-02-24 — `void _if_N` generated for second+ if-statement inside match arm
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying` — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-02-24
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Writing tests for `@derive(Deserialize)` — multiple if-statements inside `Ok(v) =>` arm
- **Description:** Inside a match arm, the first `if` statement works correctly, but subsequent `if` statements generate `void _if_N;` temporaries in C (to store the if-expression result), which is invalid C. Workaround: extract logic into a separate function so each function body has at most one if inside the match arm, or restructure to a single if/else chain. Root cause: the if-expression result type inference defaults to `CT_VOID` inside match arm scope.

### 2026-02-24 — `infer_enum_from_node` misidentifies Result-returning method calls as enum constructors
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying` — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-02-24
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** `let s = Shape.from_json(...)` where Shape is a data enum and from_json returns Result
- **Description:** `infer_enum_from_node` checks if a MethodCall's object is an enum type name, and if so returns that enum name. This causes `let` bindings of `Type.from_json(...)` (which returns `Result[Type, Str]`) to be registered as enum variables via `var_enums`, which then makes `match s` take the data-enum scrutinee path instead of the Result path. Fixed by clearing `enum_type` when `val_type == CT_RESULT` after expression evaluation.

### 2026-02-24 — Closure param name shadows outer `let mut` — codegen emits wrong variable
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying` — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-02-24
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Defining closures with a parameter name that matches an outer `let mut` variable (e.g. outer `let mut req = ...` + closure `fn(req: Request) -> Request { ... }`)
- **Description:** When a closure parameter has the same name as an outer mutable variable, the codegen incorrectly treats references to the parameter inside the closure body as captures of the outer mutable cell (`*req_cell`). The generated C dereferences a `void*` pointer instead of using the closure's own parameter. Workaround: use a different parameter name in the closure to avoid shadowing (e.g. `fn(r: Request) -> Request { ... }`). The codegen's capture analysis should check whether a name resolves to a closure parameter before looking at outer scope mutable variables.

### 2026-02-24 — Built-in function return types unknown to name resolver — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `types`
- **Severity:** `annoying` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `both`
- **Context:** Writing `test_name_resolution.pact`; `let output = shell_exec(...)` then `output.contains("...")` fails with `UnresolvedMethod`
- **Description:** The name resolver doesn't know the return types of built-in functions (`shell_exec`, `read_file`, etc.). When their return value is stored in a variable and a method is called on it (e.g. `.contains()`, `.trim()`), the resolver can't verify the method exists because it doesn't know the variable is a `Str`. Even explicit type annotations (`let output: Str = shell_exec(...)`) don't help — the resolver doesn't use them for method validation. Workaround: avoid method calls on built-in return values, or delegate to shell commands. Fix: the resolver needs a type registry for built-in functions so it can propagate return types to local variables.
- **Resolution (2026-03-01):** Investigation showed built-in return types ARE correctly propagated — `read_file` (Str), `get_arg` (Str), `path_join` (Str) etc. all resolve methods. The original `shell_exec` issue was a misunderstanding: `shell_exec` returns Int (exit code), not command output, so `.contains()` is correctly rejected. E0505 error message improved to include receiver type (e.g. "on type Int") for clearer diagnostics. Test: `examples/test_builtin_methods.pact`.

### 2026-02-25 — No `\"` escape sequence in strings — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `syntax`
- **Severity:** `annoying` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `both`
- **Context:** Writing test code that constructs JSON strings inline
- **Description:** Pact strings don't support `\"` as an escape sequence for double quotes inside strings. This makes it impossible to write string literals containing double quotes. Must construct them via `Str.from_char(34)` or similar workarounds. Common in JSON, SQL, HTML, and any data format that uses double quotes. Spec should define `\"` as a valid escape sequence alongside `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`.
- **Resolution (2026-02-25):** Was already implemented in lexer (lexer.pact:835). Friction was a documentation gap — escape sequence table added to spec §2.4.

### 2026-02-25 — `bin/pact build` returns exit code 0 on C compilation failure
- **Category:** `tooling`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** CI test runner silently passing tests that actually fail to compile
- **Description:** `bin/pact build <file.pact>` prints "error: C compilation failed" to stderr but returns exit code 0 when the `cc` step fails. This causes the test runner (`task test`) to think the build succeeded, then the binary doesn't exist, and the test "crashes" with a confusing exit 127. The CLI should propagate the C compiler's non-zero exit code. Stale binaries from previous builds can mask this further — a test appears to pass because it runs an old binary.

### 2026-02-25 — Codegen deduplicates functions by bare name, causing silent cross-module body swaps
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `blocking`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Inlining the compiler pipeline into the CLI binary brought lexer, toml, and json modules together for the first time
- **Description:** `is_emitted_fn()` in codegen_types.pact checks the bare Pact function name (e.g., `is_alpha`), not the module-qualified C name (e.g., `pact_lexer_is_alpha`). When two modules define functions with the same name but different bodies, the first one emitted wins — the second is silently dropped. The `mod_fn_prefix` map is also keyed on bare name, so last-registered module prefix overwrites earlier ones. This caused: (1) toml's `is_alpha` (no underscore) replacing lexer's `is_alpha` (with underscore), breaking all identifier parsing; (2) json's `is_ws` (includes newlines) replacing toml's `is_ws` (space+tab only). Workaround: renamed colliding functions with module prefixes (`toml_is_alpha`, `toml_is_ws`, `toml_skip_ws`). Proper fix: dedup on fully-qualified C name, or key `mod_fn_prefix` on `(module, name)` tuples.

### 2026-02-25 — No raw string syntax makes embedding text content impossible — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `spec-gap`
- **Severity:** `blocking` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `both`
- **Context:** Trying to embed llms reference text as a string literal in cli.pact
- **Description:** The spec deliberately chose "one string syntax" with universal interpolation and double quotes only — no raw strings, no backticks, no single quotes. This makes it impossible to embed large text blobs containing `{`, `}`, and `"` characters without escaping every one. Use cases: embedding documentation, regex patterns, code templates, test fixtures. Even `\{` escaping exists but manually escaping thousands of characters is impractical. A raw string syntax (e.g., `r"..."` or triple-quoted `"""..."""`) is needed for any serious text embedding.
- **Resolution (2026-03-01):** Two-part fix. (1) `#embed("path")` for large external blobs (§2.4.1, panel 5-0). (2) `#"..."#` extended delimiter strings for inline strings with many `"` or `\` characters (§2.4.2, panel 5-0). Interpolation via `#{expr}`. Eliminates triple-escape stacking (`\\\"`) in codegen. Locked "one string syntax" preserved — parametric extension of same delimiter.

### 2026-02-25 — CLI argparser lacks command-scoped flags and routing
- **Category:** `tooling`
- **Severity:** `annoying` → **partially resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Adding new commands to cli.pact requires updating two hardcoded exclusion chains
- **Description:** `std.args` provides flat flag/option parsing but no command-scoped routing. Every command that doesn't require a source file must be added to a growing `command != "init" && command != "llms" && ...` chain (cli.pact lines 604 and 610). Adding a command means updating two separate exclusion lists. A command-scoped approach (where each command declares its own required positionals and flags) would eliminate this.
- **Partial resolution (2026-02-28):** Added nested subcommand support (`add_command(p, "daemon.start", ...)`) and `command_add_positional` to `std.args`. Daemon now uses proper subcommands. The exclusion chain problem remains for non-daemon commands.

### 2026-02-28 — Codegen loses element type for `List[T]` parameters
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Implementing nested subcommands in `lib/std/args.pact`
- **Description:** When a function takes `List[SomeStruct]` as a direct parameter, the codegen loses the element type info for items obtained via `.get().unwrap()`. Field access on the unwrapped item produces `int64_t.field` in C instead of a proper struct access. The same pattern works fine when the list is accessed through a struct field chain (e.g., `p.commands.get(i).unwrap().name`). Workaround: wrap `List[T]` in a struct (`type CmdList { items: List[CommandDef] }`) and pass the wrapper. This adds boilerplate (`wrap(cmds)` calls everywhere) but produces correct C.

### 2026-03-05 — `\r` escape sequence emits literal backslash-r, not CR
- **Category:** `codegen`
- **Severity:** `annoying`
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Building HTTP benchmark server, stdlib `format_response` in `lib/std/http_server.pact`
- **Description:** String literal `"\r\n"` emits `\` + `r` + `\` + `n` (4 literal chars) instead of CR (0x0D) + LF (0x0A). The `\n` escape IS supported (produces 0x0A), but `\r` is not — it becomes a literal backslash + `r`. This means `format_response` in the HTTP stdlib produces malformed HTTP responses that Go's `net/http` (and `hey`) reject as "malformed MIME header". Workaround: `Char.from_code_point(13).concat(Char.from_code_point(10))` stored in a mutable global set at init time. The lexer (`src/lexer.pact`) handles `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"` but appears to be missing `\r`. Also affects `\0` and `\b`/`\f` if those are expected.

### 2026-03-06 — Extended string `#"..."#` lexer bug: `"#{` parsed as end delimiter + hash — ✅ RESOLVED
- **Category:** `syntax`
- **Severity:** `blocking` → **resolved**
- **Source:** `ai`
- **Context:** Building HTTP+SQLite benchmark, constructing JSON with interpolation inside extended strings
- **Description:** Inside `#"..."#` extended strings, the sequence `"#{expr}"` (double-quote immediately before interpolation `#{`) is misparsed. The lexer sees `"#` and treats it as the end delimiter of the extended string, rather than recognizing that `#{` starts an interpolation expression. Example: `#"name: "#{x}", done"#` fails, but `#"name: "User #{x}", done"#` works because the `"` is not immediately followed by `#`. The greedy match of `"#` as end-delimiter takes priority over `#{` as interpolation-start.
- **Resolution (2026-03-06):** Added lookahead in lexer.pact:908 — when checking for extended string end delimiter `"#...#`, also verify that the char after the `#` sequence is NOT `{`. If it is, treat `"` as literal and let the `#{` be handled as interpolation start. Test: `examples/test_extended_strings.pact` (3 new cases for `"#{` pattern).
