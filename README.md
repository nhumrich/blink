# Pact

A programming language designed by AI for the age of AI-assisted development.

Pact was created through a multi-expert AI panel process — multiple AI specialists independently designed, debated, and voted on every language decision. AI made every decision, and every single lanaguage feature is chosen for reasons which are documented. The result is a language optimized for the human-AI-compiler collaboration loop: unambiguous syntax that AI generates correctly on the first try, an effect system that makes side effects visible in every signature, and a contract system where the compiler proves your code does what you said it would.

**Status:** v0.3 spec. Self-hosting compiler achieved — the Pact compiler, written in Pact, compiles itself to native binaries via C. [Read the full spec →](SPEC.md)

## 30-Second Tour

### Hello World

```pact
fn main() {
    io.println("Hello, world!")
}
```

No imports. No ceremony. `main` has implicit effects.

### Variables and Strings

```pact
fn main() {
    let name = "Alice"
    let mut count = 0
    io.println("Hello, {name}!")    // every string interpolates
    count = count + 1
}
```

Immutable by default. `let mut` is an explicit opt-in. Every string supports `{expr}` — no prefix needed.

### Functions and Effects

```pact
fn add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    a + b
}

fn greet(name: Str) ! IO {
    io.println("Hello, {name}!")
}
```

Pure functions declare no effects. Functions that touch the outside world declare them with `!`. If a function says `! IO`, it can print. If it doesn't, it can't. The compiler enforces this.

### Types

```pact
// Product type (struct)
type User {
    name: Str
    email: Str
}

// Sum type (enum)
type Status {
    Active
    Banned(reason: Str)
}

// Refinement type
type Port = Int @where(self > 0 && self <= 65535)
```

One keyword for all type definitions. Refinement types let the compiler prove constraints at compile time.

### Pattern Matching

```pact
fn describe(s: Status) -> Str {
    match s {
        Active => "Active"
        Banned(reason) => "Banned: {reason}"
    }
}
```

Exhaustive. The compiler rejects missing cases.

### Error Handling

```pact
fn parse_port(s: Str) -> Result[Port, ParseError] {
    let n = s.parse_int()?           // ? propagates errors
    if n < 1 || n > 65535 {
        return Err(ParseError.OutOfRange(n))
    }
    Ok(n)
}

let port = env.var("PORT") ?? "8080"  // ?? defaults on None
```

No exceptions. No null. `Result[T, E]` for errors, `Option[T]` for absence.

### Contracts

```pact
@requires(amount > 0)
@ensures(result.is_ok() => result.unwrap().balance == old(acct.balance) + amount)
pub fn deposit(acct: Account, amount: Int) -> Result[Account, AccountError] {
    if amount <= 0 {
        return Err(AccountError.InvalidAmount)
    }
    Ok(Account { id: acct.id, owner: acct.owner, balance: acct.balance + amount })
}
```

`@requires` is a precondition. `@ensures` is a postcondition. The compiler attempts to prove them via SMT solver — proven means zero cost, disproven means compile error with counterexample, unknown means a runtime check is inserted.

### Traits

```pact
trait Display {
    fn display(self) -> Str
}

impl Display for User {
    fn display(self) -> Str {
        "{self.name} <{self.email}>"
    }
}
```

### Generics

```pact
fn first[T](items: List[T]) -> T? {
    items.get(0)
}

let users: Map[Str, List[User]] = build_index()
```

Square brackets. No angle-bracket ambiguity. `T?` is shorthand for `Option[T]`.

### Effects and Handlers

```pact
fn fetch_data(url: Str) -> Result[Str, NetError] ! Net.Connect, IO.Log {
    io.log("Fetching {url}")
    net.get(url)?.body()
}

// Mock the network for testing
fn mock_net(responses: Map[Str, Str]) -> Handler[Net.Connect] {
    handler Net.Connect {
        fn get(url: Str) -> Result[Response, NetError] {
            match responses.get(url) {
                Some(body) => Ok(Response.new(200, body))
                None => Err(NetError.ConnectionRefused("no mock for {url}"))
            }
        }
    }
}

test "fetch with mock" {
    with mock_net(Map.of([("https://example.com", "ok")])) {
        let result = fetch_data("https://example.com")
        assert_eq(result.unwrap(), "ok")
    }
}
```

Effects are capabilities. Handlers provide implementations. Swap them in tests for free dependency injection — no frameworks, no interfaces, no boilerplate.

### Tests

```pact
test "deposit increases balance" {
    let acct = open_account(1, "Test")
    let result = deposit(acct, 500)
    assert(result.is_ok())
    assert_eq(result.unwrap().balance, 500)
}
```

First-class. No test framework to import. Just `test "name" { ... }`.

### Intent and Provenance

```pact
@i("Move money from one account to another atomically")
@src(req: "BANK-004")
@requires(amount > 0)
pub fn transfer(amount: Int, -- from: Account, to: Account) -> Result[(Account, Account), AccountError] {
    let updated_from = withdraw(from, amount)?
    let updated_to = deposit(to, amount)?
    Ok((updated_from, updated_to))
}
```

`@i` declares human intent — structured, versioned, queryable. `@src` links to requirements. These aren't comments. They're compiler-checked metadata.

## Design Principles

1. **Optimize the generate-compile-check-fix loop.** Sub-200ms incremental compilation. Structured diagnostics. One way to write everything.
2. **One way to do everything.** No style debates. One string syntax, one error model, one test runner, one formatter.
3. **Locality of reasoning.** A function's behavior is determinable from its signature, body, and imports. No action-at-a-distance.
4. **Intent is code.** The "why" lives in the language, not in comments that rot.
5. **Make correctness cheap.** Types → effects → contracts → tests. Each layer catches more bugs for less effort.
6. **Effects are capabilities.** A function that doesn't declare `! Net` cannot touch the network. Period.
